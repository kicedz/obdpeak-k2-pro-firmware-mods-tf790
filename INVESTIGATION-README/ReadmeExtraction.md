# Notes on Rebuilding Modified Firmware

This document outlines the challenges and risks associated with modifying and rebuilding extracted firmware components, specifically in the context of changing logos.

**It is highly unlikely that simply extracting components, modifying logos, and re-packing with standard tools will result in a 100% functional, identical firmware.** Attempting to flash improperly rebuilt firmware carries a significant risk of **bricking** the device (rendering it unusable).

Here's a breakdown of the key challenges:

1.  **Proprietary Headers/Structure:**
    *   Firmware images often have custom headers, specific data layouts, and metadata required by the device's bootloader.
    *   Standard extraction tools like `binwalk` identify known components but don't necessarily understand or preserve the *overall structure* of the original image.
    *   Rebuilding requires precise knowledge of how the original image was constructed.

2.  **Missing Components:**
    *   `binwalk -e` extracts only what it *recognizes*. 
    *   Other data sections, padding bytes, or specific empty spaces at particular offsets might be critical for the bootloader but are not standard file types.
    *   These essential but unrecognized parts would be missing in a simple rebuild.

3.  **Compression/Container Issues:**
    *   As observed with `29E243.xz` in this firmware, the compression or container format might be non-standard, concatenated in unusual ways, or even slightly corrupted.
    *   Re-creating such specific (potentially odd) formats accurately can be difficult, yet the bootloader might strictly expect them.

4.  **Checksums/Signatures:**
    *   Many firmwares include checksums (e.g., CRC32, MD5, SHA) or digital signatures to verify integrity.
    *   Modifying *any* part (like swapping a logo image) will invalidate these checks.
    *   The device will likely reject the modified firmware during the boot or update process unless these checksums/signatures are correctly recalculated and reinserted. This often requires specific algorithms or keys, possibly only available through manufacturer tools.
    *   The `uImage header` found in this firmware, for example, explicitly contains CRC checksums for the header and data.

5.  **Filesystem Recreation Details:**
    *   While tools like `mksquashfs` (for SquashFS) or `mkfs.jffs2` (for JFFS2) can rebuild filesystems, they might use slightly different default options (compression algorithms/levels, block sizes, metadata handling, endianness) than the original build process.
    *   These subtle differences *could* potentially cause instability or prevent the system from mounting the filesystem correctly.

6.  **Exact Partition Offsets:**
    *   The bootloader expects different firmware components (kernel, filesystems, logo data, etc.) to start at *exact* byte offsets within the flash memory or the firmware image file.
    *   Simply concatenating rebuilt components is unlikely to place them at the required offsets.

**Conclusion:**

Successfully modifying firmware typically requires more than just swapping files in extracted filesystems. It often involves:

*   Reverse-engineering the exact structure of the original firmware image (headers, padding, component order, precise offsets).
*   Identifying and correctly recalculating any checksums or digital signatures.
*   Using tools (potentially vendor-specific) that can replicate the original build process accurately.

**Always proceed with extreme caution when modifying firmware and ensure you have a reliable way to recover the device (e.g., a known-good original firmware image and a working flashing procedure) before attempting any modifications.**
